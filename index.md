## About me
I am a Ph.D candidate of Department of Population Health Sciences at University of Wisconsin-Madiosn. I am interested in methods of omics data analysis and integrating the omics data in order to understand the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease.

I earned my master degree in Biostatistics at the Georgetown University, advised by Dr.Kepher Makambi. My graduation thesis is An Empirical Comparison of Different Estimation Methods for Propensity Score.
